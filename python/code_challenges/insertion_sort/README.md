[insertion_sort](insertion_sort.PNG)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Our approach was to follow the pseudocode as closely as possible for the solution
- Time O(n^2)
- Space O(1)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- Check out all the tests in the testing folder passing and try your own if you are curious
