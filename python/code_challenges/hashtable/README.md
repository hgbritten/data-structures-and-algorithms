# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- A hashtable is a table that store information in key value pairs using a special algorithm to easily find information.

## With help from
- Tim V.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Implement hashtable with add, get, contains, hash


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- I used the approach used in class. The Big O of time is O(1). Space is O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
- Check my github in the link below!
