# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Stacks are first in last out and queues are first in first out. They have nodes that contain values

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
We need to create Queue and Stack class methods to make them act sort of like linked lists with nodes and add methods to them to be able to work with them and their values

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I approached this much like LinkedList The Big O for these lists and methods are o of 1!
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
