# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- Trees are sort of like queues and stacks where they store information in Nodes. However trees know more information and can be traversed in a lot of different ways which can be extremely beneficial.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. Then create preorder, postorder, and inorder traversal methods
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- My approach was to use what we learned in class to build a preorder def. I think the Big O for this is n
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
- I don't have an API for this
