# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Our approach was to set it up just like a pre_order method but instead of appending values to a list we checked the values against each other and returned the largest number. our Big O is n
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- Check the tests!
