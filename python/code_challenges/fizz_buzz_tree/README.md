# FizzBuzzTree
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Made with Tim V
- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
- Return a new tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- This is a big O of n. We took the approach of banging our heads against the wall.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- We walked around and did stuff. Just changed the tree in place for now. All tests are in fizz_buzz_tree and test_fizz_buzz_tree
