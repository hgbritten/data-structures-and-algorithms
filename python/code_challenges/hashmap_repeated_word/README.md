## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Our approach was to turn the string into a list of words and pass those words into our hashtable while checking if they already existed. If they already exist we return the stringified word.
- The Big O of space is O(n) because we make a new list of words and the time is also O(n) because we could have to get all the way through our new list of words
