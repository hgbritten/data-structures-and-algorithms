## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Our approach was to find our origin and loops through its neighbors until we found our next city. Then restart the loop. Our Big O of time is (n) and space is O(1)


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- Solution is in test_graph_business_trip.py
