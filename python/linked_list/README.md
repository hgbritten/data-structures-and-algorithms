# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A singly linked list is a list that only points to one other node. It only has its own value and the address for the next node
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
